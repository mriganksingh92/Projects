This project aims to create a housing price prediction model using **Ames Housing dataset** evaluated on **RMSE metric.** 

**Tasks performed:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data pre-processing (data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling etc.)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Algorithm fitting post hyperparameter tuning
- Ensembling best models for overall predictions
